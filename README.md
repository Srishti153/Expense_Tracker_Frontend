# Expense_Tracker_Frontend

This is my 3rd year project. It is the frontend of a Expense Tracker Application build using React and Material UI.
It involves integrating API from the backend application. It has a dynamic dashboard which gives summarized details for monthly expenses and incomes with a graph representing money debited v/s credited. It uses a mysql database to store the data from the application.

## Following are the snapshots from the UI
